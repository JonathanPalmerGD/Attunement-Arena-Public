# AttunementArena

Attunement Arena is a splitscreen 2-4 player versus game!

Players are powerful masters of the elements.
Before a match, each player selects certain rituals to attune themselves with the elements enhancing some of their abilities.

Defeat your opponents and become the attunement master!

Abilities:
Gust: Send a burst of air in a direction, knocking targets hit back and applying recoil to yourself. Jumping automatically gusts downward. Gust can store several charges at once.
Extractor: Draw elemental energy from a source (Lava, Water or Air) which can be hurled towards enemies. The more energy drawn, the bigger the damage and effect of the projectile.
Bolt: Fires a continuous barrage of lightning in a targeted direction. If an enemy target is nearby, it will arc to strike the target.
Frigid Flight: Sends gusts of cold wind behind you accelerating you forward. Aim upwards to gain altitude!
Bubble Shield: Surround yourself in protective bubbles for several seconds. Negates the next source of damage & knockback.
